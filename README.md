# Site to help Matt Groom perform math under pressure.

Enter the climbers names.
Keep track of their attempts, zones and tops.

Once it's getting close to the end of the comp, when Matt and his co-commentator are desperately trying to figure out if Janja Garnbret can get gold (spoiler alert: she does), simply click "Analyze Podium Changes" to see the current placings and what final scores need to be achieved to reach the podium.


The site is client side only, to be run in a browser. No server storage. 
Refreshing will start with a blank comp.
